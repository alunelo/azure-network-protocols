<h1>Proton VPN Installation and Execution Lab</h1>
This project explores the fundamental IT concepts behind VPN technology using Proton VPN. The primary objective was to observe how a VPN affects network behavior, including IP address changes, location masking, DNS resolution, and encrypted traffic. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Google Chrome
- https://whatismyipaddress.com

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Key Observations</h2>

- IP Address Changes – Tracked how the public IP address changed when connecting to different Proton VPN servers worldwide.
- Location Masking – Verified geolocation data before and after VPN connection to analyze how websites and services detect user location.

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>
